# ADB (Active Developer Badge)

This bot is meant to be a simple way to get the Active Developer Badge on Discord for those who either don't have the time or don't know how to do it themselves.

This bot will not contain any genuine features or commands, it's sole purpose is to be able to run an application command, which will count as an active bot after 30 days after running the command.

## Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/playfairs/adb.git

cd adb

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

Once you start the bot, it should sync, and you should be able to run `/adb` to make the bot count as active, the embed the bot sends will tell you when you will be able to get the badge.

It's recommended to run the command every month, or you'll end up losing the badge.

Other than that, there's nothing else to do.
